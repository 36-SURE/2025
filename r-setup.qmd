## `R` and RStudio

`R` is an open-source programming language for statistical computing.
`R` is widely-used in both academia and industry, due to its capacity for statistical analysis and data science.

In order to use `R` effectively, you need a suitable editing environment, i.e. RStudio.
For more context, RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed specifically for `R` programming.
Although `R` can be run without RStudio, RStudio provides a more user-friendly experience with additional functionality.

**To download `R` and RStudio, visit [`https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop`](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop).**

You will see the following two tasks to be completed:

* **1: Install `R`**
* **2: Install RStudio**

## Step 1: Install `R`

(*Note that the following instructions apply to the latest `R` version (4.5.0) as of May 1, 2025*)

Click on ***DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL R***. This will direct you to the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) website.

**macOS**

* Click on ***Download R for macOS***.

* Choose the `.pkg` file suitable for your Mac (*Apple silicon (M1,2,..) Macs* or *older Intel Macs*.)

* Open the `.pkg` file after the download is complete.

* Follow the installation instructions.

**Windows**

* Click on ***Download R for Windows***.

* Click on ***install R for the first time*** (on the same line as the ***base*** subdirectory.)

* Choose ***Download R-4.5.0 for Windows***.

* Open the `.exe` file after the download is complete.

* Follow the installation instructions.

## Step 2: Install RStudio

::: callout-important
## Important

`R` **must** be installed before RStudio.
:::

Click on ***DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP...***
Your operating system is automatically detected.
(If your OS is not correctly detected, scroll down and choose the right version for your system.)

**macOS**

* Open the `.dmg` file after the download is complete.

* Drag and drop it to your Applications folder.

**Windows**

* Open the `.exe` file after the download is complete.

* Follow the installation instructions.

## Step 3: Check `R` and RStudio installations {#step3}

Open RStudio and type in the following command in the **Console** pane.

```{r}
#| eval: false
version
```

This will print out the current version of `R` on your machine.
The output should look similar to what shown below (the first 4 lines might be different, depending on your operating system.)

```{r}
#| echo: false
version
```

## Step 4: Install an `R` package

In `R`, a package is a collection of functions, data, and compiled code.
In addition to a set of built-in base packages, there are numerous external `R` packages written by the community to add specific functionality.

In general, to install an `R` package, you can use the `install.packages()` function and pass in the package name.

The following example shows how to install the `tidyverse` package in `R`.
The `tidyverse` is a suite of `R` packages we will be using throughout this program.
It features popular packages such as `ggplot2` for data visualization and `dplyr` for data manipulation.

After installing `R` and RStudio, open RStudio and enter the following command in the **Console** pane.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

To verify that `tidyverse` is successfully installed, run the following command:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
```

You should get a message similar to the output below.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
```

**Ask us for help if you encounter any issues or errors in any of the installation steps above.**


## `R` Primers on Posit Cloud

In addition to following the steps above for installing `R` and RStudio on your computer, **we recommend you make a free Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud) account at [`https://posit.cloud/`](https://posit.cloud/)**. 
This is a free, browser-based version of `R` and RStudio that also provides access to a growing number of relevant `R` tutorials / primers.

After you create a Posit Cloud account, navigate to the menu on the left and click on ["Recipes"](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes).
This brings up a menu of tutorials, with code primers you can choose to work through.
**Please complete the tutorials listed under "R Basics"** (you can skip the first three).
Also, feel free to explore the other tutorials.
