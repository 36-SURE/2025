This will direct you to the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) website.\n\n**macOS**\n\n* Click on ***Download R for macOS***.\n\n* Choose the `.pkg` file suitable for your Mac (*Apple silicon (M1,2,..) Macs* or *older Intel Macs*.)\n\n* Open the `.pkg` file after the download is complete.\n\n* Follow the installation instructions.\n\n**Windows**\n\n* Click on ***Download R for Windows***.\n\n* Click on ***install R for the first time*** (on the same line as the ***base*** subdirectory.)\n\n* Choose ***Download R-4.5.0 for Windows***.\n\n* Open the `.exe` file after the download is complete.\n\n* Follow the installation instructions.\n\n## Step 2: Install RStudio\n\n::: callout-important\n## Important\n\n`R` **must** be installed before RStudio.\n:::\n\nClick on ***DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP...***\nYour operating system is automatically detected.\n(If your OS is not correctly detected, scroll down and choose the right version for your system.)\n\n**macOS**\n\n* Open the `.dmg` file after the download is complete.\n\n* Drag and drop it to your Applications folder.\n\n**Windows**\n\n* Open the `.exe` file after the download is complete.\n\n* Follow the installation instructions.\n\n## Step 3: Check `R` and RStudio installations {#step3}\n\nOpen RStudio and type in the following command in the **Console** pane.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nversion\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis will print out the current version of `R` on your machine.\nThe output should look similar to what shown below (the first 4 lines might be different, depending on your operating system.)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n               _                           \nplatform       aarch64-apple-darwin20      \narch           aarch64                     \nos             darwin20                    \nsystem         aarch64, darwin20           \nstatus                                     \nmajor          4                           \nminor          5.0                         \nyear           2025                        \nmonth          04                          \nday            11                          \nsvn rev        88135                       \nlanguage       R                           \nversion.string R version 4.5.0 (2025-04-11)\nnickname       How About a Twenty-Six      \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Step 4: Install an `R` package\n\nIn `R`, a package is a collection of functions, data, and compiled code.\nIn addition to a set of built-in base packages, there are numerous external `R` packages written by the community to add specific functionality.\n\nIn general, to install an `R` package, you can use the `install.packages()` function and pass in the package name.\n\nThe following example shows how to install the `tidyverse` package in `R`.\nThe `tidyverse` is a suite of `R` packages we will be using throughout this program.\nIt features popular packages such as `ggplot2` for data visualization and `dplyr` for data manipulation.\n\nAfter installing `R` and RStudio, open RStudio and enter the following command in the **Console** pane.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo verify that `tidyverse` is successfully installed, run the following command:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou should get a message similar to the output below.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Ask us for help if you encounter any issues or errors in any of the installation steps above.**\n\n\n## `R` Primers on Posit Cloud\n\nIn addition to following the steps above for installing `R` and RStudio on your computer, **we recommend you make a free Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud) account at [`https://posit.cloud/`](https://posit.cloud/)**. \nThis is a free, browser-based version of `R` and RStudio that also provides access to a growing number of relevant `R` tutorials / primers.\n\nAfter you create a Posit Cloud account, navigate to the menu on the left and click on [\"Recipes\"](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes).\nThis brings up a menu of tutorials, with code primers you can choose to work through.\n**Please complete the tutorials listed under \"R Basics\"** (you can skip the first three).\nAlso, feel free to explore the other tutorials.",
