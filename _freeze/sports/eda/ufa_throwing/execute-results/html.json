Send your slides to Quang ([`quang@stat.cmu.edu`](mailto:quang@stat.cmu.edu)). All code must be written in `R`; but the slides may be created in any software. Take advantage of examples from lectures, but also feel free to explore online resources that may be relevant. (But be sure to always consult the `R` help documentation first before attempting to google around or ask ChatGPT.)\n\n## Data\n\nThis dataset contains throw attempts in the Ultimate Frisbee Association from 2021 to 2024. \nThe Ultimate Frisbee Association (UFA), formerly known as the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL), is the top professional ultimate league in North America.\nThe data were used in the [2025 SSAC paper by Eberhard, Miller and Sandholz](https://www.sloansportsconference.com/research-papers/a-machine-learning-approach-to-throw-value-estimation-in-professional-ultimate-frisbee) and made [available on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BradenEberhard/Expected-Throwing-Value/refs/heads/main/data/all_games_1024.csv).\n\nEach row in the dataset corresponds to a throw attempt and the columns are:\n\n* `thrower`: thrower name identifier\n* `thrower_x`: (standardized) x coordinate of thrower (position along the sideline direction; 0 represents the middle of the field, positive values denote the left side (with respect to facing the target end zone), and negative values denote the right side)\n* `thrower_y`: y coordinate of thrower (position along the end zone direction; higher `y` means closer to the target end zone)\n* `receiver`: receiver name identifier\n* `receiver_x`: (standardized) x coordinate of receiver (position along the sideline direction; 0 represents the middle of the field, positive values denote the left side (with respect to facing the target end zone), and negative values denote the right side)\n* `receiver_y`: y coordinate of receiver (position along the end zone direction; higher `y` means closer to the target end zone)\n* `receiver`: receiver name identifier\n* `turnover`: whether the throw results in a turnover\n* `possession_num`: possession number within a game\n* `possession_throw`: throw number within a possession\n* `game_quarter`: quarter within a game\n* `is_home_team`: whether the offense is the home team\n* `home_team_score`: home team score\n* `away_team_score`: away team score\n* `gameID`: unique identifier for game\n* `home_teamID`: home team name identifier\n* `away_teamID`: away team name identifier\n* `times`: game time remaining (seconds)\n* `home_team_win`: whether home team wins\n* `score_diff`: score difference between home and away teams\n* `goal`: whether the throw results in a goal\n* `throw_distance`: throw distance (yards)\n* `x_diff`: difference in x coordinates between thrower and receiver\n* `y_diff`: difference in y coordinates between thrower and receiver         \n* `throw_angle`: throw angle (radians, 0 means forward, $\\pi$ means backward, positive values mean to the right, and negative values mean to the left of the thrower)\n\n\n## Starter code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nufa_throws <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/36-SURE/2025/main/data/ufa_throws.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn case you're curious, the code to build this dataset can be found below.
