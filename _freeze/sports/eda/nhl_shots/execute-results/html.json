Send your slides to Quang ([`quang@stat.cmu.edu`](mailto:quang@stat.cmu.edu)). All code must be written in `R`; but the slides may be created in any software. Take advantage of examples from lectures, but also feel free to explore online resources that may be relevant. (But be sure to always consult the `R` help documentation first before attempting to google around or ask ChatGPT.)\n\n## Data\n\nThis dataset contains all shot attempts from the 2024-25 NHL regular season, courtesy of [MoneyPuck.com](http://moneypuck.com/data.htm).\n\nEach row in the dataset corresponds to a shot attempt and the columns are:\n\n-   `shooterPlayerId`: player id of the skater taking the shot\n-   `shooterName`: first and Last name of the player taking the shot\n-   `team`: team taking the shot\n-   `shooterLeftRight`: whether the shooter is a left or right shot\n-   `shooterTimeOnIce`: playing time in seconds that have passed since the shooter started their shift\n-   `shooterTimeOnIceSinceFaceoff`: minimum of the playing time in seconds since the last faceoff and the playing time that has passed since the shooter started their shift\n-   `event`: whether the shot was a shot on goal (SHOT), goal, (GOAL), or missed the net (MISS)\n-   `location`: the zone the shot took place in\n-   `shotType`: type of shot\n-   `shotAngle`: angle of the shot in degrees, positive if the shot is from the left side of the ice.\n-   `shotAnglePlusRebound`: difference in angle between the previous shot and this shot if this shot is a rebound, is otherwise set to 0\n-   `shotDistance`: distance from the net of the shot in feet, net is defined as being at the (89,0) coordinates\n-   `shotOnEmptyNet`: whether the shot was on an empty net\n-   `shotRebound`: whether the shot is a rebound, i.e., if the last event was a shot and within 3 seconds of this shot\n-   `shotRush`: whether the shot was on a rush, i.e., ff the last event was in another zone and within 4 seconds\n-   `shotWasOnGoal`: whether the shot was on net - either a goal or a goalie save\n-   `shotGeneratedRebound`: whether the shot generated a rebound shot within 3 seconds of the this shot\n-   `shotGoalieFroze`: whether the goalie froze the puck within 1 second of the shot\n-   `arenaAdjustedShotDistance`: shot distance adjusted for arena recording bias - uses the same methodology as [War On Ice](http://blog.war-on-ice.com/index.html%3Fp=512.html) proposed by [Schuckers and Curro](https://www.statsportsconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/Schuckers_Curro_MIT_Sloan_THoR.pdf)\n-   `arenaAdjustedXCord`: x coordinate of the arena adjusted shot location, always a positive number\n-   `arenaAdjustedYCord`: y coordinate of the arena adjusted shot location\n-   `goalieIdForShot`: player id for the goalie the shot is on\n-   `goalieNameForShot`: first and Last name of the goalie the shot is on\n-   `teamCode`: team code of the shooting team\n-   `isHomeTeam`: whether the shooting team is the home team\n-   `homeSkatersOnIce`: number of skaters on ice for the home team (does not count the goalie)\n-   `awaySkatersOnIce`: number of skaters on ice for the away team (does not count the goalie)\n-   `game_id`: game id of the game the shot took place in\n-   `homeTeamCode`: home team in the game\n-   `awayTeamCode`: away team in the game\n-   `homeTeamGoals`: home team goals before the shot took place\n-   `awayTeamGoals`: away team goals before the shot took place\n-   `time`: seconds into the game of the shot\n-   `period`: period of the game\n\nNote that a full glossary of the features available for NHL shot data can be found [here](http://peter-tanner.com/moneypuck/downloads/MoneyPuck_Shot_Data_Dictionary.csv).\n\n## Starter code\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nnhl_shots <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/36-SURE/2025/main/data/nhl_shots.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case you're curious, the code to build this dataset can be found below.
